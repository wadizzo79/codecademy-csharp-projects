# Codecademy C# Projects

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of Codecademy’s C# learning path.

Each folder represents a standalone project or practice task designed to reinforce specific C# concepts.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice core C# programming concepts
- Apply object-oriented programming principles
- Gain hands-on experience through guided projects

## Topics Covered
Across the projects in this repository, I practiced:
- C# syntax and fundamentals
- Variables, conditionals, and loops
- Methods and classes
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections and basic data structures
- Debugging and problem-solving

## Repository Structure
- Each directory contains a separate Codecademy project
- Projects are independent and can be reviewed individually
- Folder names generally reflect the project or exercise focus

## How to Run
Most projects are console-based C# applications.

To run a project:
- Open the project folder in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- Build and run the program using the .NET CLI or IDE tools

## Notes
- These projects were completed for learning purposes.
- Some implementations may be simplified to match course requirements.
- Code may be revisited and improved as my understanding grows.
